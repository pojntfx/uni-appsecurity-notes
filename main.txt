Organization

-   60 Minutes of test at the end
-   Will have practical examples
-   Threat detection plays a fundamental role in tests

Overview

Elements of a Secure Development Process

Primary purpose: Analysis of the data flow; data is both protected by
the GDPR and represents value of the corportation

-   Requirements
    -   Security-Requirements
    -   Anti-Requirements
    -   Abuse cases
    -   Protection poker
    -   → Security analysis/architecture analysis
-   Draft
    -   AuthN/AuthZ
    -   Drafting concepts
    -   Risk modelling
-   Implementation
    -   Secure implementation guidelines
    -   Code review, dynamic analysis
-   Tests
    -   Security testing plans
    -   Security testing cases
    -   Ethical hacking, pentesting, dynamic analysis
-   Operations/Maintenance
    -   Secure initial settings
    -   Assumptions of runtimes
    -   Observation of logs
    -   Processes for management and reaction to breaches
-   Documentation
    -   Installation
    -   Configuration
    -   Customization
    -   Operations
    -   → Impact area of security incidents must be visible*

Support Hierarchy

-   Level 1: Direct support with customers; call center, non-technical
-   Level 2: People who know about typical problems with the software
-   Level 3: Developers of the software

Basics

What is Secure Software?

-   Software which is protected against intentional attacks
-   Every participant in the software development process should be
    interested in this objective
-   Software must be hardened against all known attacks (and future,
    unknown attacks)

What is Security?

-   $Risk = \frac{Cost\ of\ breach}{Probability\ of\ breach}$
-   A system is protected against threats compromising valuable data
    using measures which lead to a reduced, accepted risk.
-   Accepted risk is defined by context of use (i.e. nuclear power: very
    low accepted risks)
-   Safety: Protection of the environment from the functional effects a
    system
-   Security: Protection of the system from threats from the environment
-   Concrete definitions: uni-itsec-notes#security-objectives; most
    importantly (“CIA objectives”):
    -   Confidentiality
    -   Integrity
    -   Availability
-   If there are contractions between the security objectives (anonymity
    vs. accountability): The context defines which objectives dominate
    over others

CISSP Domains/Certificates

-   Security Engineering: Engineering and Management of Security
-   Security Assessment and Testing: Designing, Performing and Analyzing
    Security Testing
-   Security Operations: Foundational Concepts, Investigations, Incident
    Management and Disaster Recovery
-   Software Development Security: Understanding, Applying and Enforcing
    Software Security
-   → This course strives for 80% of TPSSE compliance

Why Security?

-   Security is context dependent: On localhost and unprotected UNIX
    socket isn’t an issue, but forward it with socat and it becomes a
    massive security vulnerability!
-   With every change every test needs to be run again (regression
    testing)
-   Typically ~30 errors in every 1000 lines of code
-   Growing application complexity
-   Devices are more and more connected which reduces the need for
    physical access
-   Extensible architectures

Common Terms

-   Exploit/Proof of Concept
-   Attack
-   Vulnerability
-   Threat
-   Error

1.  Threat agent gives rise to threat
2.  Threat exploits vulnerability
3.  Vulnerability leads to risk
4.  Risk can damage asset and causes exposure
5.  Exposure can be countermeasured by a safeguard
6.  Safeguard directly affects threat agent

Threat Agents

-   Virus (i.e. infection)
-   Hacker (i.e. unauthorized access)
-   User (i.e. wrong config, data loss)
-   Fire (i.e. damage to computers)
-   Worker (i.e. leaking)
-   Other corporations (i.e. industrial espionage)
-   Black hats (i.e. buffer overflows, DoS)
-   Intruders (i.e. physically stealing drives)

Researching Vulnerabilities

-   Classifying vulnerabilities by severity (low, middle, high)
-   Classifying vulnerabilities by exploit range (local or remote)
-   Intents to find trends and attacks
-   Intents to find vulnerabilities before they can be exploited
-   Intents to find countermeasures

CVSS Metrics

Results in a number which can be used to classify the vulnerability.

-   Base Score Metrics
    -   Exploitabilility Metrics
        -   AV: Attack Vector: Network, Adjacent Network, Local,
            Physical
        -   AC: Attack Complexity: Low, High
        -   PR: Privileges Required: None, Low, High
        -   UI: User Interaction: None, Required
        -   S: Scope: Unchanged, Change
    -   Impact Metrics (CIA Metrics)
        -   C: Confidentiality Impact: None, Low, High
        -   I: Integrity Impact: None, Low, High
        -   A: Availability Impact: None, Low, High
-   Temporal Score Metrics
    -   E: Exploit Code Maturity: Not defined, unproven that exploit
        exists, proof of concept code, functional exploit exists, high
    -   RL: Remediation Level: Not defined, official fix, temporary fix,
        workaround, unavailable
    -   RC: Report Confidence: Not defined, unknown, reasonable,
        confirmed
-   Environmental Score Metrics: Extends base score metrics, but are
    specific to exploited organization
    -   Impact Subscore Modifiers
        -   CR: Confidentiality Requirement: Not defined, low, medium,
            high
        -   IR: Integrity Requirement: Not defined, low, medium, high
        -   AR: Availability Requirement: Not defined, low, medium, high

Balancing Security

-   Security is always a balance between functionality and usability
-   Security often means to have restrictions in terms of features

Writing Secure Software

-   Many sections
    -   Secure development practices
    -   Secure development process (supply chain security)
    -   Security reviews
    -   Pentesting
-   Time and money should be invested into all sections according to
    individual risk, not only into a singular section

Finishing Thoughts

-   Systems are only secure if all elements of the system are secure
-   Perimeter and infrastructure security can not make the entire system
    secure
-   Applications are always connected
-   Development of secure systems is not a choice, but a must!

Web Application Security

Legal notes

-   Unauthorized breach of security systems is illegal
-   Unauthorized eavesdropping is illegal
-   Distribution or usage of “hacking tools” is illegal (which has
    however been relativized by judges)

Components of Web Environments

-   Web server (no business logic, static content)
-   App server (business logic, Tomcat etc.)
-   Databases
-   Middleware
-   LDAP
-   Reverse Proxies
-   Web Application Firewalls
-   Load Balancers
-   Firewalls

Targets

-   Browser
-   Transport
-   Web server
-   Web application
-   Backend
-   Network components
-   Partner connections (i.e. Sentry, Monitoring etc.)

Risks in the Layered Architecture

-   Client presentation layer: Validation
-   Browser: Browser sandboxing etc.
-   Encryption in transport
-   Server presentation layer: Input & output validation
-   Logging: Auditing
-   Error handling: Secure error escalation
-   All layers: Authorization & authentication checks
-   Encryption to database
-   Data protection in database

Methods to find Vulnerabilities

-   Security audit
    -   Checks if previously established security guidelines have been
        implemented
    -   Assessment of configuration
-   Vulnerability assessment
    -   Scans for known vulnerabilities
    -   Can point in directions, but not show concrete exploits
-   Pentesting
    -   Security audit and vulnerability assessment is included
    -   Shows how vulnerabilities can be exploited

Pentesting Process

1.  Pre-Attack Phase
    1.  Rules of engagement must be noted in a contract
    2.  Customer’s requirements need to be queried
    3.  Enumeration
        1.  Passive: Enumerating without having access to client’s
            network
        2.  Active: Scanning
2.  Attack Phase:
    1.  Perimeter breach
    2.  Access
    3.  Exploit/privilege escalation
    4.  Keeping access
    5.  Removing all traces
3.  Post-Attack Phase:
    1.  Restoring the pre-attack state
    2.  Writing the report
    3.  Posting recommendations on how to continue (i.e. fixing the
        vulnerabilities)
